# GameGridLinkedList
Game where user travels blindly from one side of grid to the other in a 2D array. Each move is tracked with a Linked List.
2D array is created consisting of '1''s (which represent a wall) and '0''s (which represent a passage). 
User starts at position '0,0' and must move to either the right hand side or bottom of the grid.
The user is asked for input to move right or down. 
If they hit a wall (1) they lose. 
Once they reach either the right or bottom, they have won. 
After the game is completed, the game grid is printed tracking each users move, as well as displaying their ending position.
